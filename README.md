### The game of chicken, Meteor style. Who will chicken out first?
-----------------------

This is a little app I wrote in order to:
  1. gain experience with Meteor
  2. experiment with animation & graphics using SVG
  3. have fun!

It's about as simple as a game can get (the player has ONE degree of freedom), but I learned several things in the process of making it. There's still room for improvement, of course, so if you have an idea for making it better / cleaner / faster / etc., send me a pull request!

So go play the game already... What are ya, CHICKEN?!?
